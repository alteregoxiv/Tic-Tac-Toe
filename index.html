			Hey how are you doing today?<br><br>
			We are all familiar with the game that takes us back to the "glorious days" entitled "Tic-Tac-Toe".
			Peaceful competition among friends to determine who is the best or fighting over who actually won the game or 
			tearing up the entire paper even before the game finishes as you know that you are about to lose---Today we bring back
			all of the fun , silliness & laughter back only with a graphical representation.<br><br>
			Click on the "START" Button , fill in your names and preferred symbols and begin.<br><br>
			Hope it'll help you travel to your happy days.
